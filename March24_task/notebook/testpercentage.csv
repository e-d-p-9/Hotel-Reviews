0,8884,"Excellent hotel in a great location. Close enough to the French Quarter, Canal St and the Riverwalk but far enough away from the hustle and bustle! Staff were accommodating, gracious and always had smiles! They were able to find us a room at an early time in the day, it was great! The hotel is older but well maintained. The rooms were spacious, nice and cold A/C and clean! Not to mention, the fresh croissants delivered to your room every morning were amazing! Our bed was a bit squeaky when laying in it or tossing and turning but other than that the room was great!I would highly recommend this small, boutique style hotel to anyone coming to New Orleans, whether a night or a week.",0,1.0

Everything in the room seemed fine, except for my master-control panel - some of the features just wouldn't work (phone, radio control, etc.) - I never called for assistance, just got by with using the other phone (think there were four phones total in the room). Bed and linens were OMG spectacular. Slept like a baby and felt wonderful when I woke up!Took any early morning swim in the pool - very nice - and it was great that the pool is open 24/7. Fitness center was well-equipped, and super clean.Ate Breakfast at the hotel restaurant - which was lovely, but quite expensive. Lobby bar and main restaurant looked lovely, but I didn't have a chance to experience them. Visited the Museum of African Diaspora which is accessible from first floor of the hotel - very nice place. The hotel has a great location for visiting the fine arts museums - many within a block or two - Yerba Beuna Gardens, Jewish Heritage, Museum of Modern Art. Also just a couple blocks from the high-end shopping of Union Square.If you are seeking a space of serene luxury in the heart of the SF hustle and bustle, the St Regis definitely delivers.",1,1629,100

No trouble locating Pike's Place with that view! Room was spotless and bed super comfy. Pillows are little lacking too soft, no support but we still slept really well. Check in was a breeze. When they heard it was our 25th, the gal comped our valet for the entire stay and sent up a bottle pinot grigio! We appreciated her thoughtfulness and enjoyed the wine. Bathroom is luxurious and spotless. Huge shower and separate huge tub were glorious! First time spending a significant amount of time in Seattle and we loved every minute. Thanks Hyatt, we'll be back!",1,712,100

652,1233,"My husband and I recently stayed at the River Hotel while on a long weekend getaway to Chicago. It is in the absolute heart of downtown, and VERY conveniently within walking distance of just about everything touristy (Magnificent Mile, the bean at Millenium Park, we even walked all the way to the Shedd Aquarium). We got a really good rate for the room. It was small, however was still cozy. We had a river view and a fabulous view of the word TRUMP (..tower across the street). The only reason I would rate this 4 and not 5 stars is the bed... was... not at all comfortable, and I hate to say that. Both my husband and I were not well rested the entire weekend. None the less, it was perfect for what we needed and we had a great time! Staff was super friendly as well.Dear Hillary W,Thank you for choosing to stay at the River Hotel. We truly appreciate you taking the time for your review as all feedback is welcomed. I am so pleased you found the staff friendly and were able to enjoy our prime location in the heart of the city.

The staff was outstanding in every encounter I had with them. The beds were great, the view isn't great, but the windows were large. And the interior of the hotel is just plain gorgeous. The coffee bar is very nice since we love French-pressed coffee there is a small frig in the room as well. I only wish it was in a quieter location.

760,1460,"This hotel is fantastic in so many ways. Check-in was a breeze as we were warmly welcomed. Upon inspecting our corner room, I saw that it was 2 double beds for our romantic getaway, which was not what I had planned. In a few minutes after calling the front desk, the clerk personally came up to accompany us to the same room 2 floors higher with a king bed--perfect! It was a suite but we have never seen such spacious hotel accommodations. The living room was huge the bedroom oversized as well. The bathroom was tiny, but not a problem. We have a round window that opened from the shower it was fun to open it a crack watch the street below as I showered! However, the street below was a problem overnight because the Sorrento is 2 blocks from the Virginia Mason emergency room entrance where all the ambulances begin end. I was awakened by sirens all night long, this wasn't even over a weekend! That is the only negative aspect of our stay, but it's enough to keep me from going back.

As you mentioned, we are located two blocks from the hospital, but by city ordinance, the ambulances are supposed to turn off their sirens when they are four blocks away. Please know that I will be following up with our local ambulance services about their compliance with this ordinance. Otherwise, I was pleased to see that you enjoyed your experience. We look forward to seeing you again soon! My best, Sam Johnson",2,1837,100

I gave the erroneous bill to the desk staff. She looked at it and I told her which one was billed erroneously. Then she said what day is that... Good grief.. she was LOOKING at the bill. Finally just said Take the charge off now. I guess from talking to the manager that it is hit or miss whether you can a new or an old mattress. And after all, a good nights sleep is a BASIC requirement for business travel. I will not stay here again... period... obviously customer comfort is not 1.And what did I get my all this trouble 1,000 extra points. That's it, Marriott UIC.. None of my business for you!",1,1698,100

I will say that the bed is a bit on the soft side, which may or may not be to your liking.Naturally, being in such a great city, we didn't spend much time in the hotel room, other than to sleep at night. Each time we came back, the rooms were tidied professionally, with any minor messes we made taken care of. The front desk staff were equally friendly and approachable, and were accommodating to the strange requests that I made of them. One final item of note is that light sleepers may want a room away from Post St, or perhaps consider a hotel not in this area at all. As luck would have it, Post is a one-way street, and just up the street is a San Francisco Fire Department depot, and because of our room, we could hear/see the trucks whiz by every single night. Despite being 7 floors up, there is still quite a lot of noise. Similarly, I'm guessing there is a Police Department or something in the area, as we heard those noises every night as well.All this boils down to the bottom line: would I stay here againIf the rating didn't quite spell it out for you, the answer is yes, assuming I'm doing stuff in this part of town, and I don't want to rent a car. Given the prices of all the other hotels in this area, Kensington Park offers one of the best combinations of location and price around.",1,3129,100

Valet parking is 40 a day...pretty high. would recommend hotel once they get the private event closures under control..Dear Susan S.Thanks for your feedback about your recent stay with us. I'm very happy to hear your kind words about our facility and the location certainly can't be beat! I did want to acknowledge your frustration about the event being held at our deck. As you can imagine, it's quite a popular space. Due to its large size we're normally able to section off part of it for private events so that all of our guests can enjoy the area. I appreciate the feedback about what you encountered and want to apologize. We'll make sure that we're cognizant about the best use of the area. Thanks again and I hope you can make it back soon.

1635,3271,"We spent three nights at the BW on St. Charles - a wonderful stay. The hotel is very conveniently located on St. Charles, about halfway between Tulane/Loyola and downtown New Orleans. The tram runs in front of the hotel, but we never heard a thing from our room. It is walking distance from Commander's Palace, where we had an unforgettable dinner one evening. You are right there to see all the beautiful homes of the Garden District and to visit Magazine street. The hotel itself is so accommodating. The breakfast is bountiful - hot and cold items, and lots of fresh fruit. They keep coffee, tea and fresh-fruit-flavored chilled water available all day. In the afternoon they put out warm, fresh-baked cookies. In the evening, there are grapes and cheese. All on the house! There is a decent-enough and very friendly Mexican-style restaurant and lounge attached. We ate there our first evening and cannot complain. What is nice, once again, is that the restaurant is a bit loud, but we never heard it from our room. Everything about this hotel is great. I would recommend it to any friend or family member, and would definitely stay here again.",1,950,100

Instead the refurb is happening on the third of three floors on both wings and banging noises can be heard throughout the entire hotel. We are frequent travellers and we always require the hotels we stay in to be quiet and 100 comfortable. My wife was ill with a stomach bug and needed to sleep. My daughter is a 20 month old toddler and needs to take sleeps throughout the day. The constant hammering from the workmen prevented this. I contacted the front desk 3 times to complain and the banging continued despite assurances it would be dealt with. I eventually walked to reception with my daughter in my arms and made my grievance known to the staff that I felt I was not being listened to. I was then contacted by staff and told I could move if I wished to another room where no noise was guaranteed. I think they fail to see the point. I don't see why guests should have to repack all their belongings and move to accomodate the disturbance. The disturbance should move or quit to accomodate the guests. It's not rocket science. It's a shame because the hotel is nice and the staff are pleasant. I am not usually easily rattled but banging noises in a hotel - NO WAY!Please allow me to extend my sincerest apologies for the noise disturbance during your stay. I can assure you that many months of careful planning have gone into our renovation and the decision to renovate by floor rather than wing was made based on a number of factors, one being guest safety. Based on the layout of our rooms and elevator location, a different plan would have required our guests to walk through a construction zone to reach their rooms. Not every stage of the renovation is affiliated with noise and the fast majority of our guests are not disturbed at all. I am truly sorry that your wife and daughter were not able to rest peacefully and hope we can make it up to you during your next visit.",1,1992,100

We (family of 4 adults) did not want to stay at one of the chains and had stayed on Coronado island and the Lodge at Torrey Pines before so we gave Estancia a try and were very satisfied. The staff was nice and very helpful with beautiful landscaping and vegetation, even in the middle of a severe drought. There were 2 walking paths from the hotel with one going to the glider port/beach which was cool watching the para gliders launch and sail along the cliff (both para and hang gliders available for tandem rides) and the other path going through a nice neighborhood to Black's beach which had a fairly steep road at the end which got your heart going on the way back. The girls had no trouble finding chairs at the pool and raved about the Spa's Hanakasumi and Inspire 80 minute massages. I would head to the fitness center in the afternoon while they were out sunning and was the only one in there (although I heard that the mornings usually had a crowd). There are 4 treadmills, 2 bikes, 2 ellipticals with free weights to 45 lbs and 4 machines ie enough for a basic workout. We did the kayaking/snorkeling tour from La Jolla Kayak with the kayaking being the better activity (although having a sea lion swim by while snorkelling in one of the caves was pretty cool). We usually ordered in breakfast which was good with ample portions. The best breakfast though was at The Cottage, a must if you enjoy breakfast. We went the good but casual restaurant route with George's at the Cove terrace and the Brockton Villa (stay inside to avoid sea lion aroma) for good food with a view and Piazza 1909 for a step above the pecan crusted/fish taco fare. All were topped off with gelato from Bobboi's. We were there for 4 nights during the week and all were able to truly unwind and relax. The only nit I had was that the housekeeping staff never understood that we had 4 adults so daily calls for more coffee cups etc was needed but overall, we would definitely stay again.Dear Mathonthego.Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay.

We first came on a Weds which was a an evening they had free Mexican food and a drink in the lobby which was good enough for our dinner that night. The room was fine and the beds were comfortable. The staff were all pleasant and even the housekeepers like Carmen, gave us warm greetings each day. The views over the city especially at sunset were enjoyable and the patios had pretty plants.

The small danish was good and so was the choc ice frosted doughnut .There was a problem though after I ate some, I went into elevator back to our room 417.Instead I got off 3rd floor and got scared I knocked on 2 doors which I though were our side of the floor. You see they have a stupid ad for pizza on our room key but no room . My friend said they got scared cuz of the way the elevator made a jerking noise, this thing was probably never updated since the hotel began in 1910's, from what I read it was a Comfort Inn at one time, I wonder if it failed to meet standards and was dropped from the chain...Anyway my one encounter with the front desk was ok, I had to tell her his name",1,3019,80
3216,6548,"My friend said he liked the charm and age of our room. Said it reminded him of a European hotel.Okay so it's 88 outside and same inside! Why two reasons One Ac is off! Two AC is clogged, and my friend mentions that it's a model from the 1970's!He had to find a way to open the front of Ac, then I took the screen and turned on the tub to wash it out. Which clogged the drain at 1st, I never knew a screen could hold so much dirt, this thing probably hadn't been cleaned for years! They need to get 2014 Acs. Other than the front lobby which was nice and cold the rest of hotel was broiling. The hall way reminded me of the place I live where its hard to breathe! Just terrible!I was thinking of giving this place a 3 but due to their low handed trickery I went with a 2 instead.The bed was hard as a board! I'm surprised I even slept. I woke up with a kink in my neck.Thankfully we did not come across anything bad that I read about...While I did see some care taken to the room, I feel the managers wishes are pie in the sky as far as improvements 2014 or 2016 etc. The bed was just horrible.Now my friend did mention something I thought was cute we got a double room with individual bathrooms, Both had big closets too. It seemed so same sex like both of these touches.The rainbow flag flew outside this hotel.My favorite thing is the tv was nice we had a 40 in Samsung. I bought a LG for my apt 2 yrs ago. Samsung actually looks a slight bit crisper or its newerLocation is what you pay for here! Although on their room key they have an ad for Domino's, walk down North Broadway and get real Chicago style pizza that was yummy from Renaldi's After Dark 2831 N Broadway StChicago, Illinois 60657 . I had the last piece of our large pie for lunch yesterday. I could only eat 3 slices it was so big, and the crust so thick.!I'm glad I gave Renaldi's pizza a try, I go to Aldi's to shop, and Aldi's had this brand Reggio's from Chicago that gave me heartburn the sauce is too rich and hot, but Renaldi's thankfully isn't anything like this. Really this was the highlight of my Chicago stop over on way back to NY. We went just before we checked in.As for this service Inn speaks of, thats kind of a joke! Let me tell you why...my friend calls on street by his parked car at 7 PM 7/21/2014 after we have eaten.At first lady can't answer his about a rate for tonight, he holds on for over 5 mins, then hangs up, calls back does it again, 3rd time they finally answer his I personally would've given up on this place after a 5 mins of non response. They need a 2nd customer service person 24/7!He asks for AARP discount and they give it to him for 40 off. So you think you're getting a good deal ....wait for it......parking....ahhhh 30 + tax to that...he states in NYC its 40 so not so bad.....anyway ..it costs 176 total for one night with tax after a 40 discount....The french toast was good, and so was the egg, it was cute how they cut up the doughnuts in half, for those watching their figure....

To add to this I can get around Chicago without a map, and I last was in the city 20 yrs ago.I guess I just thought I wouldn't have to make a mental note of room.I don't want to write a book so I'll close by saying in a way we lucked out, cuz on Tues 7/22/2014 the Cubbies were playing a game so the hotel was sold out the rest of week!Even if it wasn't close to the perfect stay, I slept ok, and was able to survive the rest of day til my friend pushed thru to get me home at midnight!Thank you for taking the time to let me know about your stay. Please be assured I will be addressing these very valid concerns. I'm very, very sorry about your stay. Please consider staying with us again so that we can provide you with an excellent stay. Again, I'm very sorry and thank you for letting me know. Paul Schoonover - General Manager",1,3770,100

The rooms are appointed well some reviewers have mentioned that the rooms are on the small side but for the price in the city I don't miss a few extra square feet and doubt you would unless you're never leaving the room. It's a great location for work or fun.Dear Ttt709,Thank you for submitting a review of your recent stay at Galleria Park! We value our guest feedback as a gift.We are truly greatful for the kind words regarding the team here at GPH. Everyone from housekeeping to the front desk takes any steps necessary to meet and exceed guest expectations.

Nice pool too with free cabanas and a bar. There's free WiFi and covered parking. Overall you won't find better value than this.Thanks for your comments. I am glad you will be back. We love return guests. There is so much to explore and enjoy on the Island you can never see it all. Thanks for staying with us.,1,652,100

The park surrounding the space needle was really nice, and super close. When we didn't want to commit to a full-on adventure, but wanted to get out and about, we would just walk across the street and explore the park and sit by the giant dome fountain, which changes how it sprays the water and was super fun to watch, and if you want to get wet, play in.A downside to the stay was the slow elevators. The first couple of days, it could take 5 minutes or more for the elevator to come, but after a lot of people seemingly checked out after the weekend, it got a lot better, but there was definitely a wait. Being on the top floor, although awesome, may have contributed to this, as when you got on the elevator it went pretty quick, so maybe it was busy with the lower floors before it went up to us.The cherry on top was the staff. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was so nice and helpful. The people who ran the front desk were always polite and helpful wit",1,2687,80
3940,7846,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed at, if not the best. We stayed for 5 nights.The room was beautiful, with a high end modern design. We stayed in a King bed studio on the 8th floor, which was the top. The bathroom had a cool sliding door, and the shower was big and very nice. The comfortable bed was separated from the area with the couch with an awesome wall divider and a swiveling TV, which was very convenient. We didn't really utilize the kitchen because we ate the complimentary hotel breakfast which kept us full until we ate out for an early dinner everyday, but it is a great feature it had a microwave, stove, dishwasher, and a majority of the dishes, utensils, and pans you would need.Speaking of the hotel breakfast, it was great. There were eggs and potatoes everyday, but they changed up the breakfast meat daily and alternated between pancakes and french toast. There were muffins, pastries, fruit, toast, cereal, oatmeal...the list goes on and on. You just have to get out of bed and get down there before it gets crazy, because the lines could be very long, and it got pretty crowded. The wait for an omelette was about half an hour usually, so I only got it once, but I like just regular scrambled eggs anyway, which was served daily. The staff worked hard to keep it stocked, but with an entire hotel full of people all trying to get food in a few hours, it could get frustrating to wait in line and see that what you wanted has run out temporarily when it got to be your turn. But overall, it was really nice with a great variety.Our room was on the side of the building that faced the space needle, which was right across the street. It was a great view of the space needle itself and of the hillsides of the surrounding area. The door to the rooftop patio was right across the hall from our room, which was great and super convenient, and didn't add any noise whatsoever. There were fire pits, ample seating, tables, and a great view on the roof.The location was great, made even better by the hotel shuttle, which will take you up to a mile away from the hotel, and pick you up as well. The shuttle drivers were amazing and kind, and this service was super helpful.

We are so happy to hear that you created wonderful memories, enjoyed the views of the iconic Space Needle from your guest room and relaxed on the rooftop terrace right outside your front door. I will pass on your kind words to the staff, I know they will be over the moon with excitement that they truly made a difference. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. Please let us know when you plan on retuning to Seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!Sincerely, Sarah Junge",1,3364,100

Fizzy drinks hyper kids!!All prams are asked to be folded on ALL transport so go ready.Be at any free shuttle 10 - 15 mins before due as they leave promptly and rightly so.Take poncho's everywhere you go.Buy one refill cup and keep returning to refill at universal and water parks and busch gardens.

The walls were thin, but since that seems to be the case in many hotels I'm usually prepared with earplugs or a fan! We weren't in the room much except for sleeping, and overall this was a great budget hotel.",1,597,100
